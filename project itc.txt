ITC Hotels Revenue Optimization


What is the total revenue generated by ITC Hotels, and how does it vary across different hotels and room categories?

Revenue = SUM(bookings[revenue_realized])


What is the cumulative revenue growth over time?

Runnig total = CALCULATE([Revenue],FILTER(ALL('calendar'),'calendar'[Date]<=MAX('calendar'[Date])))

How has the revenue grown month-over-month (MoM) and week-over-week (WoW)?

MOM%Growth = var prev_month=CALCULATE([Revenue],DATEADD('calendar'[Date],-1,MONTH)) return DIVIDE([Revenue]-prev_month,prev_month,0)

Wow%Growth = var pre_week = CALCULATE([Revenue],FILTER(ALL('calendar'),'calendar'[weekunum]=MAX('calendar'[weekunum])-1)) return DIVIDE([Revenue]-pre_week,pre_week,0


What are the average daily rate (ADR) and revenue per available room (RevPAR)


ADR1 = [Revenue]/([No show]+[checkedout]+([Cancelled]*0.4))

RevPar = DIVIDE([Revenue],SUM(occupancy[capacity]))


Page 2: Occupancy & Capacity Analysis
Key Questions to Answer:

What is the occupancy rate for each hotel and room category?

occupancy = ([No show]+[checkedout])/SUM(occupancy[capacity])

What is the cumulative occupancy trend and occupancy growth (MoM and WoW)?


MoM Occupancy Change = 
VAR prev_month = 
    CALCULATE(
        [occupancy],     
        DATEADD('Calendar'[Date], -1, MONTH)
    )
RETURN 
    DIVIDE([occupancy] - prev_month, prev_month, 0)


Wow Occupancy Change = 
VAR prev_week = 
    CALCULATE(
        [occupancy],     
        DATEADD('Calendar'[Date], -1, DAY)
    )
RETURN 
    DIVIDE([occupancy] - prev_week, prev_week, 0)



How does occupancy correlate with revenue and RevPAR?

Revenue and occupancy correlation for Date = 
VAR __CORRELATION_TABLE = VALUES('calendar'[Date])
VAR __COUNT =
	COUNTX(
		KEEPFILTERS(__CORRELATION_TABLE),
		CALCULATE([Revenue] * [occupancy])
	)
VAR __SUM_X = SUMX(KEEPFILTERS(__CORRELATION_TABLE), CALCULATE([Revenue]))
VAR __SUM_Y = SUMX(KEEPFILTERS(__CORRELATION_TABLE), CALCULATE([occupancy]))
VAR __SUM_XY =
	SUMX(
		KEEPFILTERS(__CORRELATION_TABLE),
		CALCULATE([Revenue] * [occupancy] * 1.)
	)
VAR __SUM_X2 = SUMX(KEEPFILTERS(__CORRELATION_TABLE), CALCULATE([Revenue] ^ 2))
VAR __SUM_Y2 = SUMX(KEEPFILTERS(__CORRELATION_TABLE), CALCULATE([occupancy] ^ 2))
RETURN
	DIVIDE(
		__COUNT * __SUM_XY - __SUM_X * __SUM_Y * 1.,
		SQRT(
			(__COUNT * __SUM_X2 - __SUM_X ^ 2)
				* (__COUNT * __SUM_Y2 - __SUM_Y ^ 2)
		)
	)

Page 3: Room Category Performance & Booking Insights
Key Questions to Answer:

Which room categories generate the most revenue?

 put as a chart 
Room  class in x-axis revenue in y axis

How do booking patterns (lead time, check-in dates) affect revenue and occupancy?

Booking date - check in date and alos avg length of stay

What is the average length of stay (ALOS) for each hotel and room type?

ALOS = AVERAGE(bookings[LOS])

What is the room revenue trend (including running total and MoM/WoW growth)?





Page 4: Cancellations & Lost Revenue Analysis
Key Questions to Answer:

What is the cancellation rate for each hotel and room category?

Cancellation Rate = [Cancelled]/SUM(occupancy[successful_bookings])

How have cancellation trends changed over time (MoM/WoW)?

Wow cancellation = 
VAR prev_occupancy = 
    CALCULATE(
        [occupancy],
        FILTER(
            ALL('calendar'),
            'calendar'[weekunum] = MAX('calendar'[weekunum]) - 1
        )
    )
RETURN 
    DIVIDE([occupancy] - prev_occupancy, prev_occupancy, 0)


Mom cancellation  trend = VAR prev_cancellation =CALCULATE([Cancellation Rate],DATEADD('calendar'[Date],-1,MONTH)) RETURN DIVIDE ([Cancellation Rate]-prev_cancellation,prev_cancellation,0)


What is the lost revenue due to cancellations?


Lost Revenue = ([Revenue]*[Cancellation Rate])
